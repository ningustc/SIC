# SIC
Scanning instability correction package based on python 

Highlights:

1. An improved Demons algorithm is proposed to determine the displacement fields of orthogonally scanned STEM pairs with pixel-scale spatial resolution. 
2. The beam-induced sample evolution in orthogonal scanning pairs is considered in the improved Demons algorithm.
3. Robust correction of positional errors is realized by a flowchart integrating novel initialization methods and the improved Demons algorithms. 
4. The instability of the beam current is well-considered in this flowchart.
